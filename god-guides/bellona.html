        <h3>A Guide to Bellona</h3>
        <p>Bellona is a Warrior, she has high defense, high damage and good mobility. Built with tank and damage she is a formidable foe. Her abilities allow her to iniciate, escape and kill enemies. As a Warrior she is a Physical Damage god, and she benefits from at least one Attack Speed item to increase her healing in battle (see Scourge).</p>
        
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Master of War (Passive)</h4>
        <p>When Bellon is hit by or hits an enemies Basic Attakcs, she gains Protections and Movement Speed for 4 seconds, This stacks a max of 5 times, 3% Movement Speed per stack, 4 protections per stack. For a total of up to +15% Movement Speed and +20 Protections.</p>
        
        <h4>Shield Bash (1)</h4>
        <p>Shield Bash dashes forward and knocks enemies and minions back, dealing damage and slowing by a minimum of 15%, for 2 seconds. Bellona gains 1 stack of Block for every god hit by Shield Bash, this absorbs 100% of damage from a single Basic Attack and reflects 30% back to the enemy. After dashing Bellona weilds a Swords and Shield until out of combat and with every third basic attack she gains another Stack of Block up to 3 stacks.</p>
          
        <h4>Bludgeon (2)</h4>
        <p>Bellona switches to a hammer, spinning, hitting enemies around her and then smashes down damaging in a line in front of her. Each enemy god hit by the spin increases the damage of the hammer smashing down by 30%. After the ability is used Bellona uses the hammer for basic atacks until out of combat. The damage of this ability is increased by up to 60% of her Physical Power.</p>
        
        <h4>Scourge (3)</h4>
        <p>Bellona summons a flail as her weapon and smashes it down in a line in front of her, upon hitting enemy gods they are disarmed for a minimum of 2 seconds, and can't use basic attacks. She continues to use the flail until out of combat, every third hit with Scourge heals Bellona. This means Bellona can use the fail and gain its healing benefits for as long as she can keep hitting enemies.</p>
        
        <h4>Eagle's Rally (4)</h4>
        <p>Bellona leaps into an area, laying a large circle around a flag granting Protections and increased Physical Power to allies in the circle. Enemies near the center of the circle take damage and are stunned for 1 second. The flag last for a minimum of 6 seconds. This ability is useful for catching up with fleeing enemies, initiating attacks and for escaping.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>A powerful combination is Shield Bash, damaging, slowing and providing Block stacks (allowing Bellona to absorb basic attacks), into Bludgeon, which deals damage, and finally Scourge, which deals damage and heals Bellona.</p>
          <p>Eagle's Rally is best used to iniciate fights or to land on top of fleeing enemies. Eagles's Rally along with the combination attack mentioned above will kill or leave most enemies near death.</p>
          <p>Using Scourge (3) to heal is an important part of playing Bellona, it allows her to stay near the action.</p>
          <p>Using Bellona's Ultimate to escape should be considered if needed.</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Only enemies near the center of Bellona's Ultimate are stunned and damaged when she leaps.</p>

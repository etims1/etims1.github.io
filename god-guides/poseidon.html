        <h3>A Guide to Poseidon</h3>
        <p>Poseidon is a Mage with high damage and mobility</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Changing Tides (Passive)</h4>
        <p>Poseidon has a tidal meter above his ability panel. He gains Movement Speed and his abilities do additionnal damage as his Tide Level increases. Successful basic attacks hits increase his Tide Level and using abilities decreases it. At High tide abilities deal up to 20% more damage and Poseidon's Movement Speed is increasd by 10%.</p>
        
        <h4>Tidal Surge (1)</h4>
        <p>Poseidon summons a wave which travels in a line in front of him, damaging and knocking back all enemies hit. Damage is increased +70% of his Magical Power. Tidal Surge decreases the Tidal meter by 35%.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>This ability can be easy to dodge because it moves slowly. Using it to clear waves, or in combination with Whirlpool (which applies a slow to enemies) will make most efficient use of it.</p>
          
        <h4>Trident (2)</h4>
        <p>Trident activates a self-buff which grants a Movement Speed increase and making his basics attacks fire 2 additional shots in a spread for 6 seconds. The shots deal 20% more damage, based on Poseidon's Magical Power. Successful shots increases his Tidal Level.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>This ability helps Poseidon increase his Tide level quickly. It should be used while your abilities are on cooldown to build the level ready for when your abilities return.</p>
        
        <h4>Whirlpool (3)</h4>
        <p>Poseidon summons a whirlpool at a ground location in front of him, pulling enemies to the center. The whirlpool cripples (prevents movement abilities) and damages every 0.5 seconds for 3 seconds. Whirlpool reduces Poseidon's Tidal Level by 25%. Damage is increased by +15%.</p>
        
        <h4>Release the Kraken (4)</h4>
        <p>Summoned at a target location in front of him, a Kraken appears front a large whirlpool damaging and slowing enenmies caught. Enemies in the center take additional damage, are knocked into the air and stunned. The Kraken reduces Poseidon's Tidal meter by 50%. Damage is increased by 30%, up to 60% at the center of the ability.</p>
        <p class='itallic'></p>

        <div class='spacing'></div>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>Keeping Poseidon's Tide level high is important as he deals most of his damage through his abilities. High Tide adds an adiitional 20% damage.</p> 
          <p>A powerful combinaiton is Whirlpool (3) to cripple, slow and damage, into Kraken (4) to really damage and stun. If the enemy are still alive a Tidal Surge (1) can be used to finish them off. This makes use of that stun, as Tidal Surge moves so slowly.</p>
          <p>Below level 5, when Poseidon doesn't have his Ultimate, Whirlpool (3) into Tidal Surge (1) is his main ability combination. However combinations don't have to be used all the time.</p>
          <p>If Poseidon is being chased he can drop a Whirlpool (3) at his feet, which will slow the nemy behind him. He can also turn around and use Tidal Surge (1) to knockback and damage the enemy.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Poseidon's basic attacks have a limited reach. However he is not supposed to be a basic attack god (although he can be built that way). Poseidon's abilities have better range.</p>
          <p>Only enemies near the center of Release the Kraken (4) will be stunned. The stun is useful to make it easier to hit Tidal Surge (1).</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing Against Poseidon</h4>
          <p>Tidal Surge (1) can be dodge easily due to its slow movement speed.</p>
          <p>Purification Beads can remove the cripple, slow and stun of Poseidon's Whilpool and Kraken. Saving Purification Beads for when Poseidon Kraken's you will allow you to escape, however damage will still be taken.</p>
          <p>An Aegis Pendant or a different type of Aegis can stop you recieving damage from Poseidon's Ult.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>

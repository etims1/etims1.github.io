        <h3>A Guide to Ymir</h3>
        <p>Ymir is a Magical Damage Guardian who excells at Crowd Control (CC). His main function is to disrupt, stun and corner, all while being able to tank large amounts of damage.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Frostbite (Passive)</h4>
        <p>All of Ymir's abilities which damange or stun enemies apply the debuff Frostbite. Targets affected by Frostbite recieve 100% more damage from Ymir's basic attacks.</p>
        
        <h4>Ice Wall (1)</h4>
        <p>Ice Wall summons a wall of ice that blocks player movement. As you level this ability its active duration is increased, from 2 seconds to a maximum of 6 seconds. Ice Wall can be used in a multitude of situations: stopping fleeing enemies, protecting allies, protecting your retreat and more.</p>
          
        <h4>Glacial Strike (2)</h4>
        <p>Glacial Strike is a medium length damaging and slowing ability projected in front of Ymir. Damage is increase by 70% of your Magical Power. The slow lasts for 4 seconds.</p>
        <p>Glacial Strike can be used in combination with Ice Wall on minions. Laying Ice Wall in front of running minions, allowing them to bunch up and casting Glacial Strike through Ice Wall allows him to hit all the minions. However Ice Wall is an important team defense ability, so it shoul not be wasted.</p>
        
        <h4>Frost Breath (3)</h4>
        <p>Frost Breath is a medium sized cone shaped stun and damaging ability cast in front of Ymir. The stun lasts a minimum of 1.25 seconds, increasing to 2.25 seconds when leveled up. It's damage is increased by 50% of his Magical Power. </p>
        <p>This ability is very versatile, it can be used during a fight initiation, or during a retreat. Once frozen Glacial Strike can be used and Ice Wall to stop the enemy retreat.</p>
        
        <h4>Shards of Ice (4)</h4>
        <p>Channeled in a large circle around Ymir for 3 seconds, Shards of Ice then erupts, damaging all enemies within the circle. While channeled it slows enemies by 30% to reduce their ability to escape. The damage delt is increased by 150% of his Magical Power. If enemies get close to leaving the ability radius Shard of Ice can be detinated early by right clicking.</p>
        <p>This ability can also be used in combination with Frost Breath, freezing then ulting for massive damage.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>Ymir with Greater Blink is a frightening foe. The ability to teleport, freeze (3) and ult (4) is a powerful team fight initiation.</p>
          <p>Ymir's main combination attack is Frost Breath, Glacial Strike, Ice Wall to prevent retreat.</p>
         <p>With level two boots, during online play latency (lag) allows Ymir to look at his feet while running, spawn a wall, and it will appear behind him. This is great for escaping. You will need boots to achieve this. During practise matches, or LAN games latency is too low to allow this, and it will spawn in front of Ymir instead.</p>
          
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Ymir is slow. Even with shoes he's slow. Just keep that in mind when initiating and protecting.</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing against Ymir</h4>
          <p>When playing against a Ymir, press tab to check if they have Blink, you need to be ready for a Blink, Frost Breath (3), Glacial Strike (2) / Shards of Ice (4) combo. This is Ymir's best team fight initiation tactic.</p>
          <p>If you are at risk by being frozen by Frost Breath (3) and are already close to Ymir, running behind him can allow you to miss the freeze as Frost Breath is cast in a cone in front of Ymir. </p>
        <p>If you can't escape Ymir Ultimate and are going to die, attacking Ymir can help your team mates kill him later, or you could deal enoguh damage to kill him yourself.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>

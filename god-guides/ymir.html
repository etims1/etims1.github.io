        <h3>A Guide to Ymir</h3>
        <p>Ymir is a Guardian who excells at Crowd Control (CC). His main function is to disrupt, stun and corner, all while being able to tank large amounts of damage.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Frostbite (Passive)</h4>
        <p>All of Ymir's abilities which damange or stun enemies apply the debuff Frostbite. Targets affected by Frostbite recieve 100% more damage from Ymir's basic attacks.</p>
        
        <h4>Ice Wall (1)</h4>
        <p>Ice Wall summons a wall of ice that blocks player movement. As you level this ability its active duration is increased, from 2 seconds to a maximum of 6 seconds. Ice Wall can be used in a multitude of situations: stopping fleeing enemies, protecting allies, protecting your retreat and more.</p>
          
        <h4>Glacial Strike (2)</h4>
        <p>Glacial Strike is a medium length damaging and slowing ability projected in front of Ymir. Damage is increase by 70% of your Magical Power. The slow lasts for 4 seconds. Glacial Strike can be used in combination with Ice Wall on minions. Laying Ice Wall in front of running minions, allowing them to bunch up and casting Glacial Strike through Ice Wall allows you to hit all the minions. However Ice Wall is an important team defense ability, so it shoul not be wasted.</p>
        
        <h4>Frost Breath (3)</h4>
        <p>Frost Breath is a medium sized cone shaped stun and damaging ability cast in front of Ymir. The stun lasts a minimum of 1.25 seconds, increasing to 2.25 seconds when leveled up. It's damage is increased by 50% of your Magical Power. This ability is very versatile, it can be used during a fight initiation, or during a retreat. Once frozen Glacial Strike can be used and Ice Wall to stop the enemy retreat.</p>
        
        <h4>Shards of Ice (4)</h4>
        <p>Channeled in a large circle around Ymir for 3 seconds, Shards of Ice then erupts, damaging all enemies within the circle. While channeled it slows enemies by 30% to reduce their ability to escape. The damage delt is increased by 150% of your Magical Power. If enemies get close to leaving the ability radius Shard of Ice can be detinated early by right clicking. This ability can also be used in combination with Frost Breath, freezing then ulting for massive damage.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>Ymir with Greater Blink is a frightening foe. The ability to teleport, freeze (3) and ult (4) is a powerful team fight initiation.</p>
          <p>Ymir's main combination attack is Frost Breath, Glacial Strike, Ice Wall to prevent retreat.</p>
         <p>During online play latency (lag) allows you to look at your feet while running, spawn a wall, and it will appear behind you. This is great for escaping. During practise matches, or LAN games latency is too low to allow this, and it will spawn in front of you instead.</p>
          
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Ymir is slow. Even with shoes he's slow. Just keep that in mind when initiating and protecting.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above.

Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>

On Ymir this item is useful for initiating team fights.

While Greater Blink enjoys a 70 second cooldown, however you can't have been in combat for 5 seconds before blinking.</p>

        <h3>A Guide to Neith</h3>
        <p>Neith is a Physical Damage Hunter who excells at lane clearing, in part due to her high Sustain (long-term mana &amp; health regeneration), allowing her to stay near combat without returning for long periods. She can also do well against enemy gods from early game thanks to her multiple stuns and roots. Built with Critical Chance increasing items she has impressive damage late game.</p>
        
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Broken Weave (Passive)</h4>
        <p>A Broken Weave is left behind in th location of an enemy god kill and last for 60 seconds. Weaves give her abilities secondary effects when combined (see abilities for more information).</p>
        
        <h4>Spirit Arrow (1)</h4>
        <p>Spirit Arrow is a medium range projectile ability which passes through multiple gods (it also travels through walls), damaging and rooting all it hits. Upon hitting a Broken Weave, the Weave detonates dealing an extra 100% damage and applying the root in an area around the Weave. The root lasts for a minimum of 1.2 seconds. Damage is increased by 90% of her Physical Power.</p>
          
        <h4>Unravel (2)</h4>
        <p>Unravel damages and adds a 30% attack speed debuff to enemies within the target area, additionally it heals Neith for up to 3 enemies hit. If any Weaves are within the target area they add additional healing and are removed. Physical Power is important to Neith as Healing on enemies hit is increase by 15%, Weave Healing 30% and damage is increased by 80% of her Physical Power. The speed debuff lasts for a minimum of 2 seconds.</p>
        
        <h4>Back Flip (3)</h4>
        <p>Neith back flips through the air, leaving behind a Broken Weave and damaging and slowing enemies by 25% for a minimum of 2.5 seconds in the area in front of her. Neith is immune to damage while in the air during Back Flip. If Neith find herself in the middle of an enemy ultimate, Back Flip can reduce the damage taken.</p>
        
        <h4>World Weaver (4)</h4>
        <p>World Weaver is a global damage and stun, which can target anyone on the map as long as Neith has minimap vision of the enemy. World Weaver can fire through obsticals. The ability takes a few seconds to charge, but can be released for reduced damage and stun. The stun lasts a minimum of 1.1 seconds.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>Dropping Unravel (2) on minions during a fight with an enemy god can be the different between living and dying, and depending on the situation is better than using the ability on the enemy god.</p>
          <p>Unravel can be used on jungle camps to heal, while staying far enough away not to take damage. Very useful for retreating through a jungle.</p>
          <p>Utilizing Broken Weaves is very important to playing Neith well. Running forward and back flipping to leave Weaves in strategic places is a standard tactic. When enemies come near, Spirit Arrow (1) to damage and root in an area of affect, or Unravel (2) to damage, and heal yourself.</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>World Weaver (4) can be blocked by enemies, for example a good Guaridan will step into the path of World Weaver and tank the damage to protect a weaker team mate. As a result this ability is perhaps best used from afar, out of sight of the enemy, this way the enemy are unaware of their or a team mates impending doom.</p>
      
      <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing against Neith</h4>
        <p>Neith's first ability, Spirit Arrow can travel through walls, when running away from a Neith be aware of this. Ducking behind the first corner you find in the jungle doesn't mean you're safe.</p>
        <p>Always be aware of Broken Weaves on the ground, Spirit Arrow (1) fired at a Broken Weave will stun in an area around the Weave.</p>
        <p>As mentioned in the Back Flip (3) section above, Neith is immune to damage while in the air during her backflip, be careful not to use Ultimates while she is in the air.</p>
        <p>Neith's Ultimate, World Weaver, requires minimap vision to lock on and fire. If you are low on health and think she has her eye on you, get away from anything that gives her vision. Enemies, minions and wards.</p>
        <p>When playing a sufficiently tanky god, a Guardian or Warrior, stepping in front of World Weaver to absorb the damage and save a weaker team mate can help the whole team.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>
        <h4>Transcendence</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Transcendence"><img alt="Image of the Smite item Transcendence" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/transcendence.jpg" /></a></div><p>Transcendence provides <strong>+35 Physical Power, +300 Mana</strong> and <strong>+6 MP5</strong>. You permanently gain 15 Mana per Stack. God kills are worth 5 stacks, minion skills 1, up to a maximum of 50 stacks. Additionally, 3% of your mana is converted into Physical Power. <strong>At full stacks Transcendence provides +1050 Mana and +66 Physical Power</strong>. This item is seen as a first item in builds due to the need to build stacks. </p>
        <h4>Titan's Bane</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Titan's Bane"><img alt="Image of the Smite item Titan's Bane" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/titans-bane.jpg" /></a></div><p>Titan's Bane adds <strong>+33% Physical Penetration</strong> and <strong>+30 Physical Power</strong>. This item is a good counter to an opposition with a lot of physical protection. Use the tab menu in-game to keep an eye on what your enemy is building.</p>
        <h4>Qin's Sais</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Qin's Sais"><img alt="Image of the Smite item Qin's Sais" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/qins-sais.jpg" /></a></div><p>Qin's Sais adds <strong>+30 Physical Power</strong> and <strong>+15% Attack Speed</strong>. It also deals 4% of the enemy gods maximum health on basic attacks. Usually seen in assassin builds, Qin's Sais is a viable replacement for Ichaival.</p>
        <h4>Malice</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Malice"><img alt="Image of the Smite item malice" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/malice.jpg" /></a></div><p>Malice provides <strong>+50 Physical Power</strong> and <strong>+20% Critical Strike chance</strong>, additionally when you achieve a critical strike you deal an extra +75% of your total Physical Power as damage over 3 seconds. Malice is a viable replacement as a 7th item, replacing Ichaival in late game for extra Critical Hit Chance.</p>
        <h4>Asi</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Asi"><img alt="Image of the Smite item Asi" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/asi.jpg" /></a></div><p>Asi adds <strong>+15% Physical Lifesteal, +20% Attakc Speed</strong> and <strong>+15% Physical Penetration</strong>. If you drop below 35% health, the Physical Lifesteal increases to 25% for 5 seconds, this can only occur once every 15 seconds.</p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        
        <h4>Actives</h4>
        <p>Choosing actives is a mix of complementing your build, your team (builds, abilities and their actives) and in response to enemy abilities. Choosing wisely can alter the outcome of a game.</p>

Using this item removes Crowd Control (CC) effects and gives an immunity to new CC effects for 3 seconds. They also reduce ability cooldowns by 3 seconds.

        <h3>A Guide to Hou Yi</h3>
        <p>Hou Yi is a Hunter, his main role is lane clear. However Hou Yi can take on players directly 1 vs. 1, this is due to his high damaging abilities, a debuff, and his passive provides Critical Hit immunity once hit by a Critical Hit (good vs Hunters &amp; Assassins). He also has a jump ability, useful for iniciating 1 vs. 1's, chasing and escaping.</p>
        
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Suntouched (Passive)</h4>
        <p>Hou Yi is immune to Critical Strikes for 3 seconds after taking a Critical Strike. This makes Hou Yi harder for Critical Stike built gods, like Assassins and other Hunters.</p>
        
        <h4>Ricochet (1)</h4>
        <p>Ricochet fires a single powerful arrow that can ricochet off walls in front of him. If this arrow bounces off a wall and hits a player it deals +50% damage per bounce, up to two bounces. Ricochet will stun for 1 second if the enemy is marked with Mark of the Golden Crow (2). Damage is increased up to 60% of your Physical Power. It is best to first mark enemies with Hou Yi's two if possible.</p>
          
        <h4>Mark of The Golden Crow (2)</h4>
        <p>Mark of The Golden Crow is a debuff which deals an extra damage, 10% of their missing health, to enemies which are marked and lasts 15 seconds. At ability level 3 marked enemies are visable to Hou Yi on the minimap (including stealthed gods), at ability level 5 Hou Yi gains +25% Penetration against the marked enemy.</p>
        
        <h4>Dive Bomb (3)</h4>
        <p>Hou Yi jumps, hanging in the air for a short duration in which he may choose a location to jump to. Upon landing he deals damage in a small area. If an enemy near him is marked with his second ability, they are knocked back. Dive Bomb's damage is increased 30% of your Physical Power. This ability is useful for catching fleeing enemies or for escaping. As a Hunter this shouldn't be used to initiate, unless perhaps, it's 1 vs. 1.</p>
        
        <h4>Sunbreaker (4)</h4>
        <p>Sunbreaker fires nine arrows into the air, after a short duration the arrows rain down in an area one after another, for 4.5 seconds and damage all enemies in the area. An enemy god caught in this ability who is marked with The Golden Crow (2) will have their Movement Speed dcreased by 20% for 0.25 seconds on every hit. Sunbreaker's damage is increased by 25% of Hou Yi's Physical Power.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>Choosing your target wisely, marking them with Mark of The Golden Crow and using your abilities on them is key. Choosing a squishy character, such as a Mage, Hunter or Assassin first. Although don't go out of your way only to attack one player.</p>
          <p>It will take practise, but trying to obtain ricochet shots will allow you to make full use of the +50 damage for such shots. Bouncing arrows of the edges of lanes, the walls of the jungle, only practise will improve your shot.</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>In 1 vs. 1's to use Hou Yi's full damage potential requires you to use Dive Bomb (3) on the target, this is your only escape ability. Once used, you are very vulnerable and anyone who knows Hou Yi's abilities will take the oppurtunity to attack you at your weakest.</p>
      
      <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing against Hou Yi</h4>
        <p>Hou Yi's third ability, Dive Bomb, can be used as an escape so he can be tricky to deal capture and kill. If you have roots, stuns or another team member does, use them first or team up.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>
        <h4>Titan's Bane</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Titan's Bane"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/titans-bane.jpg" /></a></div><p>Titan's Bane adds <strong>+33% Physical Penetration</strong> and <strong>+30 Physical Power</strong>. This item is a good counter to an opposition with a lot of physical protection. Use the tab menu in-game to keep an eye on what your enemy is building.</p>
        <h4>Qin's Sais</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Qin's Sais"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/qins-sais.jpg" /></a></div><p>Qin's Sais adds <strong>+30 Physical Power</strong> and <strong>+15% Attack Speed</strong>. It also deals 4% of the enemy gods maximum health on basic attacks. Usually seen in assassin builds, Qin's Sais is a viable replacement for Ichaival.</p>
        <h4>Malice</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Malice"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/malice.jpg" /></a></div><p>Malice provides <strong>+50 Physical Power</strong> and <strong>+20% Critical Strike chance</strong>, additionally when you achieve a critical strike you deal an extra +75% of your total Physical Power as damage over 3 seconds. Malice is a viable replacement as a 7th item, replacing Ichaival in late game for extra Critical Hit Chance.</p>
        <h4>Asi</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Asi"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/asi.jpg" /></a></div><p>Asi adds <strong>+15% Physical Lifesteal, +20% Attakc Speed</strong> and <strong>+15% Physical Penetration</strong>. If you drop below 35% health, the Physical Lifesteal increases to 25% for 5 seconds, this can only occur once every 15 seconds.</p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        
        <h4>Actives</h4>
        <p>Choosing actives is a mix of complementing your build, your team (builds, abilities and their actives) and in response to enemy abilities. Choosing wisely can alter the outcome of a game.</p>
        <h4>Greater Purification (Beads)</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Greater Purification"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/beads.jpg" /></a></div><p>Greater Purification (sometimes known, simply as "beads") is the third level of Purificaion Beads. Using this item removes Crowd Control (CC) effects and gives an immunity to new CC effects for 3 seconds. They also reduce ability cooldowns by 3 seconds. Lower level beads are as useful, however higher level beads cooldowns are faster and thus more useful.</p>
        <h4>Salvation</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Salvation"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/salvation.jpg" /></a></div><p>Salvation restores 35% of you and your team mates Mana, and 15% of you and your team mates maximim Health. If you use a lot of mana, or have a spear item slot this solid choice. Typing VVVG in game will shout your team mates to group up, so they can get healed too.</p>
        <h4>Greater Sprint</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Greater Sprint"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/sprint.jpg" /></a></div><p>Greater Sprint is the third Sprint ability. Using this item increases your movement speed by 40% for 6 seconds and makes the owner immune to slows for the duration.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Weakening Curse</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Weakening Curse"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/weakening-curse.jpg" /></a></div><p>Weakening Curse is the third Curse item, using it reduces all enemy gods movement speed by 40% and their healing is reduced by 65%.

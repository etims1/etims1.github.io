        <h3>A Guide to Sun Wukong</h3>
        <p>Sun Wukong .</p>
        
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Undefeated Body (Passive)</h4>
        <p>When below 35% health Sun Wukong gains 10% Critical Strike Change and +10 Protections, along with additional 1% Critical Strike Chance and Protection per level.</p>
        
        <h4>The Magic Cudgel (1)</h4>
        <p>Sun Wukong slams his Cudgel (weapon) down on the ground damaging all enemies in a line in front of him. Minions and Jungle Camps take +25% extra damage. Damage is increasted by 50% of his Physical Power.</p>
          
        <h4>Master's Will (2)</h4>
        <p>Sun Wukong spins around, damaging and slowing by 30% for 2 seconds all enemies close to him. Damage is increased by 50% of his Physical Power.</p>
        
        <h4>72 Transformations (3)</h4>
        <p>Sun Wukong transforms into an Tiger, Ox, or Eagle and charges forwards. The Tiger mauls the first enemy it hits, stunning for a minimum of 1 second and dealing damage. The Ox knocks back all enemies in its path, causing damage. The Eagle is the fastest and is immune to slows and roots, and is used for escape.</p>
        
        <h4>Somersault Cloud (4)</h4>
        <p>Sun Wukong leaps onto a cloud after a short charge up, leaving a copy of himself to fight on the ground. The copy inherits a percentage of Sun Wukong's streangth and defense. While on the cloud Sun Wukong is invisable and regenerates health. When the copy dies Sun Wukong is revealed on the cloud. The copy is killed instantly if hit by Hard Crowd Control (such as a stun), excluding Banishes and Knockbacks.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Weakening Curse and other anti-heal items can reduce Hercules's healing by up to 65% (Weakening Curse). Watch out for them in enemy builds and be mindful during battles, you might not heal as much as you expected.</p>

      <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing against Hercules</h4>
        <p>When playing against a Hercules players should be mindful of his pull range. Earthbreaker (2) can pull, then Hercules can use Driving Strike (1) to further push enemy gods away from their team, out of their tower radius or into his own tower radius.</p>
        <p>Mitigate Wounds (3) at ability level 5 regenerates 90% of the damage he is deal over 10 seconds. If you deal 1000 damage, he will regenerate 900 health over 10 seconds. Unless huge amounts of damage can be dealt to Hercules during a team fight, focus other more squishy players first, until your team can turn all their attention on Hercules. </p>

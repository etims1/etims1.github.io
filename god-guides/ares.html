        <h3>A Guide to Ares</h3>
        <p>Ares is a Magical Damage Guardian who excells at Crowd Control (CC). His main function is to initiate team fights and disrupt the enemy team, while being able to tank large amounts of damage.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Blessed Presence (Passive)</h4>
        <p>Blessed Presence provides Ares with +30 Magical Power for each completed aura item completed. Aura items are items which provide benefits to the team in an area around a plsayer.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>An example of such an item is Heartward Amulet, which provides allies in the area with Physical Protections. Although only two or three Aura items should be built, otherwise Ares's build will likely be inefficient. The point of this passive is to reward players for playing Support properly.</p>
        
        <h4>Shackles (1)</h4>
        <p>Shackles fires a chains in a line in font of Ares, damaging all enemies in the line. Upon hitting an enemy god the chains attach, crippling (preventing them from using movement abilities), slowing Movement Speed by 15%, dealing damage per second and buffing Ares. Shackles last 4 seconds.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>After Shakling one enemy Ares may fire another Shackle after up to 2 seconds, he can do this two more times (for a total of three shackles).</p>
          
        <h4>Bolster Defenses (2)</h4>
        <p>Bolster Defenses applies increased Protections (minimum +20) and reduced Crowd Control (minimum 10%) durations to Ares and allies around him. For each enemy god Ares has Shakled (1), the buffs are increased by 7 (21 maximum).</p>
        
        <h4>Searing Flesh (3)</h4>
        <p>Ares fires flames from his shield in a cone in front of him, damaging every .5 seconds for 4 seconds, while also damaging enemies for a percentage of their health (up to 3%). During casting Ares is immune to knockback.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>Searing Flesh is best used in combination with Shackles, once Shackled, enemies are easy targets for Searing Flesh.</p>
        
        <h4>No Escape (4)</h4>
        <p>No Escape is cast in a large circle around Ares, chaning all enemies within the area. Chained enemies are pulled towards Ares after 2.5 seconds, taking damage and are stunned for 1 second, increasing by 0.2 seconds per enemy chained. Damage is increased by 40% of your Magical Power.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>No Escape is a great initiation ability and can severly disrupt an enemy team if they don't have Crowd Control mitigation, such as Purification Beads.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>Ares's main combination is to buff himself with Bolster Defense (2), shackle the target (1) and shackle two more times spacing the casting out by 1 second and finally casting Searing Flesh (3). This combination gives Ares extra Protections  and reduces any Crowd Control effects on him, applies the maximum amount of slow and cripple time with the chains and deals damage with the final ability. If the enemy has Purification Beads, they can mitigate the Shackle, however if they use those beads, they will be defenseless against Ares's Ultimate, No Escape (4).</p>
          <p>Initiating team fights with Ares Ultimate, No Escape, can be devastating. Coupled with the active item Blink or Greater Blink, it becomes even more powerful. The ability to teleport into a group of enemies, use No Escape (4) and have the rest of your team drop everything they've got can be one of the most effective team tactics.</p>
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Ares's damage will mostly be delt over several seconds, if you can keep a target engaged Ares can deal a lot of damage. This is important to remember, as Ares won't be able to jump in and get a lot of kills, not only because he's a Guardian, but his damage is deal over a longer period due to the type of abilities he has.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing against Ares</h4>
          <p>Get Purification Beads to stop you being pulled by No Escape (4).</p>
          <p>If Ares baits you into using Purification Beads by using Shackle, there are other item options. Magi's Blessing will absorb a single Crowd Control effect every 45 seconds, an Aegis Pendant (no CC mitigation) gives damage reduction while allowing movement, or depending on the god being played one of their abilities may grant Crowd Control immuity.</p>

Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>

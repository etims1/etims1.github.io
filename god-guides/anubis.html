        <div class='large-12 coloumns'>
            <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three) the other items should be built in response to your enemy.</p>

        <h3>A Guide to Anubis</h3>
        <p>Anubis’s primary role is lane clear, due to his high area damage. In the late game Anubis has extremely high damage which allows him to take on players more directly. Magical Power and Magical lifesteal based items are important to build into Anubis.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Sorrow (Passive)</h4>
        <p>All of your abilities steal Physical and Magical Protections from your target. Each time you hit an enemy with an ability the amount you steal increases, up to 99% of your item-based Magical Lifesteal. 33% per hit, up to three times. While Magical Lifesteal items are important, with only six items slots you should aim to have a balanced build.</p>
        
        <h4>Plague of Locusts (1)</h4>
        <p>Plague of Locusts projects a large, wide cone in front of Anubis and damages per tick. The damage is increased by 40% of your Magical Power. This is a channeled ability, meaning you can right click to stop the ability to save mana if your target has moved away or died. While channeling you are rooted to the spot, but still able to rotate.</p>
          
        <h4>Mummify (2)</h4>
    <p>Mummify is Anubis’s setup, stunning for a minimum of 1.2 seconds, the enemy are helpless against the rest of his abilities. Mummify is a projectile and must be aimed.</p>
        
        <h4>Grasping Hands (3)</h4>
        <p>Grasping Hands is a large circular area damage and slow (25%). The damage is increased 30% of your Magical Power. This ability is useful for minion clearing (cast in front of a wave). When used on players strategy should be considered. The slow lasts 2 seconds and can be easily wasted if used prematurely, casting last or when the enemy runs ensures you utilize the slow.</p>
        
        <h4>Death Gaze (4)</h4>
        <p>Death Gaze is a laser-like ability, channeled line a line in front of Anubis. The reason this ability is so powerful is it damages every 0.1 ticks, meaning if the beam is sustained on an enemy they receive the full amount of damage possible, which before protections is 4500 damage. This ability is best used once the target has been stunned by Mummify (2).</p>

          <h4>Character type</h4>
          <p>Mage, Ranged</p>
          <p class='reduce-padding-top'>High Area Damage</p>
          <h4>Tactics</h4>
          <p>A powerful combination of attacks is to open with Mummify (2) to stun, Plague of Locusts (1), Grasping Hands (3) damaging and slowing a now likely running target and getting the kill with left click basic attacks. After level 5 your ultimate is an option after the stun.</p>
          <p>Grasping Hands should not be used to initiate a solo attack, the 2 second slow will be wasted. Saving Grasping Hands for enemies about to run or placed in front of already fleeing enemies will ensure the slow is utilized. During team fights disregard, a slow can be useful from the start.</p>
          
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Anubis’s one and four, Plague of Locusts and Death Gaze, once channeled root him to the ground, meaning he cannot move in any direction. He is able to rotate 360 degrees however.</p>

        <h3>A Guide to Anubis</h3>
        <p>Anubis’s primary role is lane clear, due to his high area damage. In the late game Anubis has extremely high damage which allows him to take on players more directly. Magical Power and Magical lifesteal based items are important to build into Anubis.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Sorrow (Passive)</h4>
        <p>All of your abilities steal Physical and Magical Protections from your target. Each time you hit an enemy with an ability the amount you steal increases, up to 99% of your item-based Magical Lifesteal. 33% per hit, up to three times. While Magical Lifesteal items are important, with only six items slots you should aim to have a balanced build.</p>
        
        <h4>Plague of Locusts (1)</h4>
        <p>Plague of Locusts projects a large, wide cone in front of Anubis and damages per tick. The damage is increased by 40% of your Magical Power. This is a channeled ability, meaning you can right click to stop the ability to save mana if your target has moved away or died. While channeling you are rooted to the spot, but still able to rotate.</p>
          
        <h4>Mummify (2)</h4>
        <p>Mummify is Anubis’s setup, stunning for a minimum of 1.2 seconds, the enemy are helpless against the rest of his abilities. Mummify is a projectile and must be aimed.</p>
        
        <h4>Grasping Hands (3)</h4>
        <p>Grasping Hands is a large circular area damage and slow (25%). The damage is increased 30% of your Magical Power. This ability is useful for minion clearing (cast in front of a wave). When used on players strategy should be considered. The slow lasts 2 seconds and can be easily wasted if used prematurely, casting last or when the enemy runs ensures you utilize the slow.</p>
        
        <h4>Death Gaze (4)</h4>
        <p>Death Gaze is a laser-like ability, channeled line a line in front of Anubis. The reason this ability is so powerful is it damages every 0.1 ticks, meaning if the beam is sustained on an enemy they receive the full amount of damage possible, which before protections is 4500 damage. This ability is best used once the target has been stunned by Mummify (2).</p>

        <div class='spacing'></div>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>A powerful combination of attacks is to open with Mummify (2) to stun, Plague of Locusts (1), Grasping Hands (3) damaging and slowing a now likely running target and getting the kill with left click basic attacks. After level 5 your ultimate is an option after the stun.</p>
          <p>Grasping Hands should not be used to initiate a solo attack, the 2 second slow will be wasted. Saving Grasping Hands for enemies about to run or placed in front of already fleeing enemies will ensure the slow is utilized. During team fights disregard, a slow can be useful from the start.</p>
          
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Anubis’s one and four, Plague of Locusts and Death Gaze, once channeled root him to the ground, meaning he cannot move in any direction. He is able to rotate 360 degrees however.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>
        <h4>Pythagorem's Piece</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Pythagorem's Piece"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/pythagorems-piece.jpg" /></a></div><p>Pythagorem's Piece gives the owner <strong>+70 Magical Power, +15% Magical Lifesteal</strong> and <strong>+10% Cooldown Reduction</strong>. Additionally, it <strong>gives allies within 70 units +20 Magical Power and + 10% Magical Lifesteal</strong>. Built with Bancroft's Talon it brings Anubis's Magical Lifesteal up to 27%. Magical Lifesteal items work with Anubis's passive to steal Physical and Magical Protections.</p>
        <h4>Spear of the Magus</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Spear of the Magus"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/spear-of-magus.jpg" /></a></div><p>Spear of the Magus adds <strong>+40 Magical Power</strong> and <strong>+15 Magical Penetration</strong> to your damaging abilities. Penetration items remove Protection from your enemy. If your teams composition is mostly Magical, consider building this item, as a smart enemy will build based on your teams composition.</p>
        <h4>Gem of Isolation</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Gem of Isolation"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/gem-of-isolation.jpg" /></a></div><p>Gem of Isolation adds <strong>+70 Magical Power, +250 Health</strong> and <strong>+250 Mana</strong> and adds a <strong>25% slow for 2 seconds</strong> to enemies hit by your damaging abilties. This item should be considered because oneo f Anubis's strengths is his high damage, if your enemies can escape this strength can't be used effectively.</p>
        <h4>Book of Thoth</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Book of Thoth"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/book-of-thoth.jpg" /></a></div><p>Book of Thoth gives its owner <strong>+125 Mana, +15 MP5 (Mana Per 5secs)</strong> and <strong>+100 Magical Power</strong> on purchase. This item <strong>adds additional Mana for player and minion kills</strong>, adding 5 Stacks and 1 Stacks respectiely, up to a maximum of 75 Stacks total. Additionally, 3% of your Mana is converted into Magical Power. <strong>At full Stacks Book of Thoth gives the owner +875 Mana, and +126 Magical Power</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Breastplate of Valor</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Breastplate of Valor"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/breastplate-of-valor.jpg" /></a></div><p>Breastplate of Valor gives the owner <strong>+300 Mana, +75 Physical Protection</strong> and <strong>+25% Cooldown Reduction</strong>. This item is worth considering if you are playing against Physical Damage gods or useful for ability based gods looking to reduce ability cooldown timers. Bear in mind the maximum limit on cooldown reduction is 45%, built with Chrono's Pendant, Breastplate of Valor would surpass the cap and your build would be inefficient.</p>

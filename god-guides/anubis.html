        <h3>A Guide to Anubis</h3>
        <p>Anubis is a Magical Damage Mage primary role is lane clear, due to his high area damage. In the late game Anubis has extremely high damage which allows him to take on players more directly. Magical Power and Magical lifesteal based items are important to build into Anubis.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Sorrow (Passive)</h4>
        <p>All of your abilities steal Physical and Magical Protections from your target. Each time you hit an enemy with an ability the amount he steals increases, up to 99% of your item-based Magical Lifesteal. 33% per hit, up to three times. While Magical Lifesteal items are important, with only six items slots you should aim to have a balanced build.</p>
        
        <h4>Plague of Locusts (1)</h4>
        <p>Plague of Locusts projects a large, wide cone in front of Anubis and damages per tick. The damage is increased by 40% of his Magical Power. This is a channeled ability, meaning you can right click to stop the ability to save mana if the target has moved away or died. While channeling you are rooted to the spot, but still able to rotate.</p>
          
        <h4>Mummify (2)</h4>
        <p>Mummify is Anubis’s setup, stunning for a minimum of 1.2 seconds, the enemy are helpless against the rest of his abilities. Mummify is a projectile and must be aimed.</p>
        
        <h4>Grasping Hands (3)</h4>
        <p>Grasping Hands is a large circular area damage and slow (25%). The damage is increased 30% of his Magical Power. This ability is useful for minion clearing (cast in front of a wave). When used on players strategy should be considered. The slow lasts 2 seconds and can be easily wasted if used prematurely, casting last or when the enemy runs ensures you utilize the slow.</p>
        
        <h4>Death Gaze (4)</h4>
        <p>Death Gaze is a laser-like ability, channeled line a line in front of Anubis. The reason this ability is so powerful is it damages every 0.1 ticks, meaning if the beam is sustained on an enemy they receive the full amount of damage possible, which before protections is 4500 damage. This ability is best used once the target has been stunned by Mummify (2).</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>A powerful combination of attacks is to open with Mummify (2) to stun, Plague of Locusts (1), Grasping Hands (3) damaging and slowing a now likely running target and getting the kill with left click basic attacks. After level 5 his ultimate is an option after the stun.</p>
          <p>Grasping Hands should not be used to initiate a solo attack, the 2 second slow will be wasted. Saving Grasping Hands for enemies about to run or placed in front of already fleeing enemies will ensure the slow is utilized. During team fights disregard, a slow can be useful from the start.</p>
          <p>Blink (active) can add a powerful combination attack to Anubis. Blinking near an enemy, stunning with Mummify and Death Gaze or Plague of Locusts to damage.</p>
          
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Anubis’s one and four, Plague of Locusts and Death Gaze, once channeled root him to the ground, meaning he cannot move in any direction. He is able to rotate 360 degrees however.</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing Against Anubis</h4>
          <p>Dodging Anubis's stun, Mummify is comparatively easy compared to attempting to dodge other stuns. Mummify is a projectile stun, so you can move left or right to miss the projectile if you think Anubis is about to stun you. This can be easily recognised, as he will change from staying relatively far back, behind his team mates, and suddenly want to get close to you.</p>
        <p>Running from Anubis can be quite hard because of his slows and stuns. Running in an irregular path can help you avoid the stun, and if you are playing a Hunter, Assassin or Warrior and have a free slot Sprint should be considered.</p>
        <p>If an Anubis is causing you a lot of greif, a Magical Protection item, such as Stone of Gaia which adds +70 Magical Protection, may be worth considering. However depending on your god you will be making the choice to get less damage items.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>
        <h4>Pythagorem's Piece</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Pythagorem's Piece"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/pythagorems-piece.jpg" /></a></div><p>Pythagorem's Piece gives the owner <strong>+70 Magical Power, +15% Magical Lifesteal</strong> and <strong>+10% Cooldown Reduction</strong>. Additionally, it <strong>gives allies within 70 units +20 Magical Power and + 10% Magical Lifesteal</strong>. Built with Bancroft's Talon it brings Anubis's Magical Lifesteal up to 27%. Magical Lifesteal items work with Anubis's passive to steal Physical and Magical Protections.</p>
        <h4>Spear of the Magus</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Spear of the Magus"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/spear-of-magus.jpg" /></a></div><p>Spear of the Magus adds <strong>+40 Magical Power</strong> and <strong>+15 Magical Penetration</strong> to your damaging abilities. Penetration items remove Protection from your enemy. If your teams composition is mostly Magical, consider building this item, as a smart enemy will build based on your teams composition.</p>
        <h4>Gem of Isolation</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Gem of Isolation"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/gem-of-isolation.jpg" /></a></div><p>Gem of Isolation adds <strong>+70 Magical Power, +250 Health</strong> and <strong>+250 Mana</strong> and adds a <strong>25% slow for 2 seconds</strong> to enemies hit by your damaging abilties. This item should be considered because one of Anubis's strengths is his high damage, if your enemies can escape this strength can't be used effectively.</p>
        <h4>Divine Ruin</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Divine Ruin"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/divine-ruin.jpg" /></a></div><p>Divine Ruin gives the owner +50 Magical Power, +15 Magical Lifesteal and +150 Mana. Divine Ruin primarily a anti-heal item, reducing enemies hit by your abilities healing by 40% and health regeneration for 8 seconds. A useful item when playing against a Hel, Hercules or similar heal heavy god.</p>
        <h4>Book of Thoth</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Book of Thoth"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/book-of-thoth.jpg" /></a></div><p>Book of Thoth gives its owner <strong>+125 Mana, +15 MP5 (Mana Per 5secs)</strong> and <strong>+100 Magical Power</strong> on purchase. This item <strong>adds additional Mana for player and minion kills</strong>, adding 5 Stacks and 1 Stacks respectiely, up to a maximum of 75 Stacks total. Additionally, 3% of your Mana is converted into Magical Power. <strong>At full Stacks Book of Thoth gives the owner +875 Mana, and +126 Magical Power</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Breastplate of Valor</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Breastplate of Valor"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/breastplate-of-valor.jpg" /></a></div><p>Breastplate of Valor gives the owner <strong>+300 Mana, +75 Physical Protection</strong> and <strong>+25% Cooldown Reduction</strong>. This item is worth considering if you are playing against Physical Damage gods or useful for ability based gods looking to reduce ability cooldown timers. Bear in mind the maximum limit on cooldown reduction is 45%, built with Chrono's Pendant, Breastplate of Valor would surpass the cap and your build would be inefficient.</p>
        
        <h4>Actives</h4>
        <h4>Greater Blink</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Greater Blink"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/greater-blink.jpg" /></a></div><p>Greater Blink allows the user to teleport a short distance. On Ymir this item is useful for initiating team fights. Greater Blink is the suggested choice, over combat blink, because while combat blink allows you to blink during combat its cooldown time is 180 seconds. While Greater Blink enjoys a 70 second cooldown, however you can't have been in combat for 5 seconds before blinking.</p>
        <h4>Salvation</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Salvation"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/salvation.jpg" /></a></div><p>Salvation restores 35% of you and your team mates Mana, and 15% of you and your team mates maximim Health. If you use a lot of mana, or have a spear item slot this solid choice. Typing VVVG in game will shout your team mates to group up, so they can get healed too.</p>
        <h4>Weakening Curse</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Weakening Curse"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/weakening-curse.jpg" /></a></div><p>Weakening Curse is the third Curse item, using it reduces all enemy gods movement speed by 40% and their healing is reduced by 65%. Debuffs last for 5 seconds. This item is useful for mitigating heal heavy enemies such as Hel. If not fighting a healing god, there are better choices.</p>

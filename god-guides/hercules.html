        <h3>A Beginner's Guide to Hercules</h3>
        <p>Hercules is a Warrior who has high damage and high defense. His damage is due to his passive, which gives him Physical Power as he takes damage. His defense is due to a powerful self-heal which regenerates up to 90% of the damage Hercules takes over 10 seconds. Allowing Hercules to survive where other gods would not.</p>
        
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Strength from Pain (Passive)</h4>
        <p>Hercules gains Physical Power based on a percentage of his missing health when taking damage. Up to +30 Physical Power, +1 Physical Power per level.</p>
        
        <h4>Driving Strike (1)</h4>
        <p>Hercules dashes forwards a short distance, driving all enemies back, damaging and stunning them and becomeing immune to knockback during the strike. The stun lasts for a minimum of 1.1 seconds and can increase to 1.5 seconds. Damage is increased by 90% of his Physical Power.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>Driving Strike is powerful when combined with Earthbreaker (2).</p>
          
        <h4>Earthbreaker(2)</h4>
        <p>Smashing the ground, Hercules sends a shockwave forwards in a line that damages enemies in its path. Enemies at the end of the shockawave are thrown into the air towards Hercules. Damage is increased by 50% of his Physical Power.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>This ability is useful for pulling in enemies. Coupled with Driving Strike (1), Hercules can pull, then push enemies into the tower radius or his team.</p>
        
        <h4>Mitigate Wounds (3)</h4>
        <p>Mitigate Wounds is a powerful self-heal. Upon activation it heals Hercules every seconds for 4 seconds. During this active period a percentage of the damage taken is returned to him as additional healing over the next 10 seconds.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>This makes this a unique healing ability, as it should be used on entering a fight, when Hercules is taking or about to take damage.</p>
        
        <h4>Excavate (4)</h4>
        <p>Hercules rips a boulder from the ground and throws it in front of him, dealing damage where it lands and continuing to roll and damaging any enemies it hits. Subsequent hits on the same enemy do 50% less damage per hit. The boulder bounces off solid objects, such as walls and towers and passes through enemies.</p> 
        <p class='itallic'>Damage is increased by 100% of his Physical Power. Hercules is immune to Crowd Control (CC) while casting.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>As mentioned in Mitigate Wounds (3) description, it is a unique healing ability, which requires that it be used at the start of a fight to effectively heal Hercules. As it heals, in part from damage dealt to Hercules.</p>
          <p>A powerful combination attack used to isolate, distrupt or push an enemy into your tower is Earthbreaker (2), move behind the enemy and Driving Strike (1) and push them from behind. This deals a large amount of damage and ends with the enemy being stunned for a minimum of 1.1 seconds.</p>
        <p>A variation on the above combination which usually takes a significant portion of health away from enemies is Earthbreaker (2), Driving Strike (2) and Excavate (4) while the enemy is stunned. Finishing the enemy off with basic attacks is usually possible at this point.</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Weakening Curse and other anti-heal items can reduce Hercules's healing by up to 65% (Weakening Curse). Watch out for them in enemy builds and be mindful during battles, you might not heal as much as you expected.</p>
          <p></p>
          
      <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing against Hercules</h4>
        <p>When playing against a Hercules players should be mindful of his pull range. Earthbreaker (2) can pull, then Hercules can use Driving Strike (1) to further push enemy gods away from their team, out of their tower radius or into his own tower radius.</p>
        <p>Mitigate Wounds (3) at ability level 5 regenerates 90% of the damage he is deal over 10 seconds. If you deal 1000 damage, he will regenerate 900 health over 10 seconds. Unless huge amounts of damage can be dealt to Hercules during a team fight, focus other more squishy players first, until your team can turn all their attention on Hercules. </p>

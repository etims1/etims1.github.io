        <h3>A Guide to Agni</h3>
        <p>Agni is a Mage who specialises in High Area Damage. This makes Agni good at clearing minion waves. However Agni can deal damage to players from afar with his abilties, he does not do well in close combat. Agni deals Magical Damage.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Combustion (Passive)</h4>
        <p>After hitting 4 Basic Attacks Agni gains a buff, when Flame Wave or Rain Fire is cast enemies will be set ablaze, taking 5 damage + 10% of his Magical Power for 3 seconds.</p>
        
        <h4>Noxious Fumes (1)</h4>
        <p>Agni summons a medium sized circular ground targeted cloud of fumes, which does damage every second. The cloud can be ignited by any of Agni's abilities for additional damage and stunning for 1 second. The cloud lasts 10 seconds.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>This ability is powerful when combined with Agni's Ultimate, Rain Fire. When casting Rain Fire there is a short delay, giving Agni time to cast Noxious Fumes at the same location. When Rain Fire hits it will do additional damage and stun, thanks to this ability.</p>
          
        <h4>Flame Wave (2)</h4>
        <p>Flame Wabve fires a medium sized line of flames in front of Agni, damaging all in its path. Damage is increased 50% of Agni's Magical Power.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>Flame Wave ignites Noxious Fumes and can be used in combination with it to add additional damage and add a stun.</p>
        
        <h4>Path of Flames (3)</h4>
        <p>Agni dashes forwards, leaving a path of flames behind him. Enemies passing through the flames are damaged every 0.5 seconds for 2 seconds. The damage is increased 15% of Agni's Magical Power. Path of Flames ignites Noxious Fumes. This ability can be used for escape, which is useful on a Mage as they are squishy, often targeted first characters.</p>
        
        <h4>Rain Fire (4)</h4>
        <p>Rain Fire summons meteors from the sky to a ground location, dealing huge damage in an area. Meteors are generated passively every 20 seconds and are fired at no mana cost to Agni. The halo above Agni's head indicates how many metoers he has to summon. To limit the power of this ability he can only summon 1 meteors ever 0.8 seconds, with a maximum of 3.</p>
        <p class='itallic'>It is usually not recommended to use ultimates on minion wves, however if Agni is struggling to clear a wave, with another two meteors, and the fact another will be generated in 20 seconds it is not considered a waste.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>A powerful combination can be created when using Rain Fire. There is a delay between summoning and the ability hitting the ground, this gives Agni the time to summon Noxious Fumes at the same location, adding additional damage and adding a 1 second stun to those hit.</p>
          <p>Noxious Fumes can be used to control enemy movement, by placing it somewhere you don't want them to go or to block them in. Enemies can of course choose to walk through the cloud. It is only dangerous if Agni is near by, ready to ignite it and follow up with other attacks.</p>
          <p>Another combination involves Path of Flames, when using the ability, either offensively or defensively, Noxious Fumes can be ignited after the ability has been cast as long as it overlaps the trail of flames left behind Agni. This can be useful during a fight, or escape.</p>

          
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Agni only has one form of escape, the dash, Path of Flames. Agni should be build to deal damage, with very little for additional health. As a Mage he should be near the edges of a fight, away from danger, but he may need Path of Flames when he will be inevitably targeted due to his weakness. However, that isn't to say Path of Flames shouldn't be used offensively.</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing Against Agni</h4>
          <p>Once Agni uses Path of Flames he is extremely vulnerable as he has no other escape. When it is used, now could be the time to strike.</p>
          <p>Agni can hit enmies from very long distances, using Path of Flames to get closer and the distance he can summon Rain Fire can mean he can hit you when you think you're safe. Be careful around Agni at low health.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>
        <h4>Spear of the Magus</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Spear of the Magus"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/spear-of-magus.jpg" /></a></div><p>Spear of the Magus adds <strong>+40 Magical Power</strong> and <strong>+15 Magical Penetration</strong> to your damaging abilities. Penetration items remove Protection from your enemy. If your teams composition is mostly Magical, consider building this item, as a smart enemy will build based on your teams composition.</p>
        <h4>Void Stone</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Void Stone"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/void-stone.jpg" /></a></div><p>Void Stone provides <strong>+40 Magical Power</strong> and <strong>+50 Magical Protection</strong>. While also providing an aura which reduces the Magical Protection of enemies within 55 units by 15.</p>
        <h4>Warlock's Sash</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Warlock's Sash"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/warlocks-sash.jpg" /></a></div><p>Warlock's Sash adds <strong>+50 Magical Power, +300 Health</strong> and <strong>+400 Mana</strong>. Additionally you permanently gain +3 Halth and +0.6 Magical Power per stack. 5 stacks for a god kill, 1 stack for a minion kill, with a maximum of 100 stacks. <strong>At full stacks Warlock's Sash provides +110 Magical Power, +600 Health and +400 Mana.</strong></p>
        <p>A good replacement for Book of Toth if you are looking for Health as well as Mana and Magical Power, with the trade off that it can take a while to get 100 stacks. Should be build early because of this.</p>
        <h4>Divine Ruin</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Divine Ruin"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/divine-ruin.jpg" /></a></div><p>Divine Ruin gives the owner +50 Magical Power, +15 Magical Lifesteal and +150 Mana. Divine Ruin primarily a anti-heal item, reducing enemies hit by your abilities healing by 40% and health regeneration for 8 seconds.</p> 
        <p>A useful item when playing against a Hel, Hercules or similar heal heavy god.</p>
        
        <h4>Actives</h4>
        <h4>Salvation</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Salvation"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/salvation.jpg" /></a></div><p>Salvation restores 35% of you and your team mates Mana, and 15% of you and your team mates maximim Health. If you use a lot of mana, or have a spear item slot this solid choice. Typing VVVG in game will shout your team mates to group up, so they can get healed too.</p>
        <h4>Aegis Pendant</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Aegis Pendant"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/aegis-pendant.jpg" /></a></div><p>Aegis Pendant is the third Aegis, it grants damage invulnerability for 2 seconds, preventing you from attacking but allowing you to move.</p>
        <h4 class='padding-top'>Weakening Curse</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Weakening Curse"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/weakening-curse.jpg" /></a></div><p>Weakening Curse is the third Curse item, using it reduces all enemy gods movement speed by 40% and their healing is reduced by 65%. Debuffs last for 5 seconds. This item is useful for mitigating heal heavy enemies such as Hel. If not fighting a healing god, there are better choices.</p>

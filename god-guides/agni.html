        <h3>A Guide to Agni</h3>
        <p>Agni is a Mage who specialises in High Area Damage. This makes Agni good at clearing minion waves. However Agni can deal damage to players from afar with his abilties, he does not do well in close combat. Agni deals Magical Damage.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Combustion (Passive)</h4>
        <p>After hitting 4 Basic Attacks Agni gains a buff, when Flame Wave or Rain Fire is cast enemies will be set ablaze, taking 5 damage + 10% of his Magical Power for 3 seconds.</p>
        
        <h4>Noxious Fumes (1)</h4>
        <p>Agni summons a medium sized circular ground targeted cloud of fumes, which does damage every second. The cloud can be ignited by any of Agni's abilities for additional damage and stunning for 1 second. The cloud lasts 10 seconds. This ability is powerful when combined with Agni's Ultimate, Rain Fire, when casting Rain Fire there is a short delay, giving Agni time to cast Noxious Fumes at the same location. When Rain Fire hits it will do additional damage and stun, thanks to this ability.</p>
          
        <h4>Flame Wave (2)</h4>
        <p>Flame Wabve fires a medium sized line of flames in front of Agni, damaging all in its path. Damage is increased 50% of Agni's Magical Power. Flame Wave ignites Noxious Fumes and can be used in combination with it to add additional damage and add a stun.</p>
        
        <h4>Path of Flames (3)</h4>
        <p>Agni dashes forwards, leaving a path of flames behind him. Enemies passing through the flames are damaged every 0.5 seconds for 2 seconds. The damage is increased 15% of Agni's Magical Power. Path of Flames ignites Noxious Fumes. This ability can be used for escape, which is useful on a Mage as they are squishy, often targeted first characters.</p>
        
        <h4>Rain Fire (4)</h4>
        <p>Rain Fire summons meteors from the sky to a ground location, dealing huge damage in an area. Meteors are generated passively every 20 seconds and are fired at no mana cost to Agni. The halo above Agni's head indicates how many metoers he has to summon. To limit the power of this ability he can only summon 1 meteors ever 0.8 seconds, with a maximum of 3. It is usually not recommended to use ultimates on minion wves, however if Agni is struggling to clear a wave, with another two meteors, and the fact another will be generated in 20 seconds it is not considered a waste.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>A powerful combination can be created when using Rain Fire. There is a delay between summoning and the ability hitting the ground, this gives Agni the time to summon Noxious Fumes at the same location, adding additional damage and adding a 1 second stun to those hit.</p>
          <p>Noxious Fumes can be used to control enemy movement, by placing it somewhere you don't want them to go or to block them in. Enemies can of course choose to walk through the cloud. It is only dangerous if Agni is near by, ready to ignite it and follow up with other attacks.</p>
          <p>Another combination involves Path of Flames, when using the ability, either offensively or defensively, Noxious Fumes can be ignited after the ability has been cast as long as it overlaps the trail of flames left behind Agni. This can be useful during a fight, or escape.</p>

          
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Agni only has one form of escape, the dash, Path of Flames. Agni should be build to deal damage, with very little for additional health. As a Mage he should be near the edges of a fight, away from danger, but he may need Path of Flames when he will be inevitably targeted due to his weakness. However, that isn't to say Path of Flames shouldn't be used offensively.</p>
        
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing Against Anubis</h4>
          <p>Once Agni uses Path of Flames he is extremely vulnerable as he has no other escape. When it is used, now could be the time to strike.</p>
          <p>Agni can hit enmies from very long distances, using Path of Flames to get closer and the distance he can summon Rain Fire can mean he can hit you when you think you're safe. Be careful around Agni at low health.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>
        <h4>Pythagorem's Piece</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Pythagorem's Piece"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/pythagorems-piece.jpg" /></a></div><p>Pythagorem's Piece gives the owner <strong>+70 Magical Power, +15% Magical Lifesteal</strong> and <strong>+10% Cooldown Reduction</strong>. Additionally, it <strong>gives allies within 70 units +20 Magical Power and + 10% Magical Lifesteal</strong>. Built with Bancroft's Talon it brings Anubis's Magical Lifesteal up to 27%. Magical Lifesteal items work with Anubis's passive to steal Physical and Magical Protections.</p>
        <h4>Spear of the Magus</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Spear of the Magus"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/spear-of-magus.jpg" /></a></div><p>Spear of the Magus adds <strong>+40 Magical Power</strong> and <strong>+15 Magical Penetration</strong> to your damaging abilities. Penetration items remove Protection from your enemy. If your teams composition is mostly Magical, consider building this item, as a smart enemy will build based on your teams composition.</p>
        <h4>Gem of Isolation</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Gem of Isolation"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/gem-of-isolation.jpg" /></a></div><p>Gem of Isolation adds <strong>+70 Magical Power, +250 Health</strong> and <strong>+250 Mana</strong> and adds a <strong>25% slow for 2 seconds</strong> to enemies hit by your damaging abilties. This item should be considered because one of Anubis's strengths is his high damage, if your enemies can escape this strength can't be used effectively.</p>
        <h4>Divine Ruin</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Divine Ruin"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/divine-ruin.jpg" /></a></div><p>Divine Ruin gives the owner +50 Magical Power, +15 Magical Lifesteal and +150 Mana. Divine Ruin primarily a anti-heal item, reducing enemies hit by your abilities healing by 40% and health regeneration for 8 seconds. A useful item when playing against a Hel, Hercules or similar heal heavy god.</p>
        <h4>Book of Thoth</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Book of Thoth"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/book-of-thoth.jpg" /></a></div><p>Book of Thoth gives its owner <strong>+125 Mana, +15 MP5 (Mana Per 5secs)</strong> and <strong>+100 Magical Power</strong> on purchase. This item <strong>adds additional Mana for player and minion kills</strong>, adding 5 Stacks and 1 Stacks respectiely, up to a maximum of 75 Stacks total. Additionally, 3% of your Mana is converted into Magical Power. <strong>At full Stacks Book of Thoth gives the owner +875 Mana, and +126 Magical Power</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Breastplate of Valor</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Breastplate of Valor"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/breastplate-of-valor.jpg" /></a></div><p>Breastplate of Valor gives the owner <strong>+300 Mana, +75 Physical Protection</strong> and <strong>+25% Cooldown Reduction</strong>. This item is worth considering if you are playing against Physical Damage gods or useful for ability based gods looking to reduce ability cooldown timers. Bear in mind the maximum limit on cooldown reduction is 45%, built with Chrono's Pendant, Breastplate of Valor would surpass the cap and your build would be inefficient.</p>
        
        <h4>Actives</h4>
        <h4>Greater Blink</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Greater Blink"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/greater-blink.jpg" /></a></div><p>Greater Blink allows the user to teleport a short distance. On Ymir this item is useful for initiating team fights. Greater Blink is the suggested choice, over combat blink, because while combat blink allows you to blink during combat its cooldown time is 180 seconds. While Greater Blink enjoys a 70 second cooldown, however you can't have been in combat for 5 seconds before blinking.</p>
        <h4>Salvation</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Salvation"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/salvation.jpg" /></a></div><p>Salvation restores 35% of you and your team mates Mana, and 15% of you and your team mates maximim Health. If you use a lot of mana, or have a spear item slot this solid choice. Typing VVVG in game will shout your team mates to group up, so they can get healed too.</p>
        <h4>Weakening Curse</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Weakening Curse"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/weakening-curse.jpg" /></a></div><p>Weakening Curse is the third Curse item, using it reduces all enemy gods movement speed by 40% and their healing is reduced by 65%. Debuffs last for 5 seconds. This item is useful for mitigating heal heavy enemies such as Hel. If not fighting a healing god, there are better choices.</p>

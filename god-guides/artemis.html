        <h3>A Guide to Artemis</h3>
        <p>Artemis is a Physical Damage Hunter, who's primary role is to clear a lane, however her relatively high crowd control, her trap ability (1) and Ultimate, allow her to deal large amounts of damage to the single targets she has stunned.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Still Target (Passive)</h4>
        <p>Artemis gains a passive buff called Still Target, each successive hit gains a 5% Critical Strike chance for 4 seconds, this stacks up to 3 times for a maximum 15% Critical Strike chance over a maximum of 12 seconds.</p>
        
        <h4>Transgressor's Fate (1)</h4>
        <p>This ability lays a trap on the ground, when stepped on by an enemy god it damages, stuns and cripples for 2 seconds and prevents escape abilities. The damage dealt is increased by 30% of your Physical Power. You can have a maximum of three traps on the ground at once. Traps can be used to 'wall off' jungle enterences, so you can worry less about being ganked. They are useful to disrupt enemy movement in-lane too, by forcing them to be careful.</p>
          
        <h4>Vengeful Assault (2)</h4>
        <p>Vengeful Assult activates a buff which increases Artemis's attack speed by a minimum of 35% and movement speed by 20%, both for a minimum of 3 seconds. At ability level 5 attack speed is increased by 75%, and the ability lasts for 5 seconds. After you land a few hits this ability should be used in most engagements with enemy gods, it can also be useful to speed up an escape.</p>
        
        <h4>Suppress the Insolent (3)</h4>
        <p>Cast in a medium sized circle Supress the Insolent rains down arrows from the sky, damaging and adds a 25% slow for 2 seconds to all within the circle. The damage is increased by 40% of your Physical Power. Used in conjunction with Artemis's trap this ability is sure to hit.</p>
        
        <h4>Calydonian Boar (4)</h4>
        <p>Artemis's Ultimate summons a wild boar which jumps to the closest enemy, stunning for a minimum of 1.1 seconds and damaging them, it will then jump to another enemy god and do the same until it's 6 second life is over. Upon summoning the boar Artemis is immune to Crowd Control (CC) affects for 3 seconds.</p>
        <p>This CC immunity can be used in extreme cases to escape, for example if an enemy has used their Ultimate and its pulling you in (Hades, Posiden, etc), it's acceptable to summon to boar to escape (if you don't have Purificantion Beads). After Calydonian Boar stuns an enemy, you can lay a trap beneath them to add a further stun.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>Artemis's combo's revolve around first trapping your enenmy, once trapped Suppress the Insolent (3) to call down arrows, and your second ability Vengeful Assault (2) to increase your attack speed. This combo allows you to deal the most amount of damage in the short 2 second stun of the trap.</p>
          <p>With a little practise you can place traps into the path of enemies as you fight.</p>
          <p>Use two of your three traps to disrupt enemy movement by placing them in-lane, or blocking off a jungle enterance and saving your final trap for an oppurtunity while fighting.</p>
          <p>Comboing your Ultimate and a trap by releasing the boar and placing a trap underneath them means you can stun enemies for 4 seconds, giving you time to rain down Supress the Insolent (3) and unload some basic attacks. Your enemy will likely be dead.</p>
          <p>While the oppurtunity might not arise oftern, Calydonian Boar can tank towers, so can be used to help Artemis take down objectives.</p>
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Artemis is very mana dependant and you can run out of mana quickly after using your abilities a few times. Once you're low, or out of mana, Artemis becomes very vulnerable. You loose your ability to increase Movement Speed (2) and she has no Crowd Contorl.</p>
          <p>It can be easy to miss Calydonian Boar, Artemis's Ultimate. Despite being a relatively large radius around Artemis it can be easy to summon the boar, only to have him sit there because no enemies were in the radius.</p>
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing against Artemis</h4>
          <p>The hit box on Artemis's traps is slightly larger than the trap itself, if you get too close it will pull you in, damage stun and cripple you.</p>
          <p>Vengeful Assault (2) has visual and audable cues when activated, the sound of her firing arrows changes and she holds her bow horizontally and it glows. When this happens unless you can tank the damage or she is already damaged, care is advised. With up to a 75% Attack Speed buff when activated, along with the passive Critical Hit Chance she can do a lot of damage if she hits you every time.</p>
          <p>Artemis is mana heavy, if she blindly keeps using her abilities she will become vulnerable. She won't be able to use any of her Crowd Control abilities, and can't use Vengeful Assaults (2) Movement Speed increase to escape.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>
        <h4>Transcendence</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Transcendence"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/transcendence.jpg" /></a></div><p>Transcendence provides <strong>+35 Physical Power, +300 Mana</strong> and <strong>+6 MP5</strong>. You permanently gain 15 Mana per Stack. God kills are worth 5 stacks, minion skills 1, up to a maximum of 50 stacks. Additionally, 3% of your mana is converted into Physical Power. <strong>At full stacks Transcendence provides +1050 Mana and +66 Physical Power</strong>. This item is seen as a first item in builds due to the need to build stacks. </p>
        <h4>Titan's Bane</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Titan's Bane"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/titans-bane.jpg" /></a></div><p>Titan's Bane adds <strong>+33% Physical Penetration</strong> and <strong>+30 Physical Power</strong>. This item is a good counter to an opposition with a lot of physical protection. Use the tab menu in-game to keep an eye on what your enemy is building.</p>
        <h4>Malice</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Malice"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/malice.jpg" /></a></div><p>Malice provides <strong>+50 Physical Power</strong> and <strong>+20% Critical Strike Chance</strong>, additionally when you achieve a critical strike you deal an extra +75% of your total Physical Power as damage over 3 seconds.</p>
        <h4>Asi</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Asi"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/asi.jpg" /></a></div><p>Asi adds <strong>+15% Physical Lifesteal, +20% Attakc Speed</strong> and <strong>+15% Physical Penetration</strong>. If you drop below 35% health, the Physical Lifesteal increases to 25% for 5 seconds, this can only occur once every 15 seconds.</p>
                <h4>Qin's Sais</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Qin's Sais"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/qins-sais.jpg" /></a></div><p>Qin's Sais adds <strong>+30 Physical Power</strong> and <strong>+15% Attack Speed</strong>.

        <div class='spacing'></div>
        
        <h4 class='padding-top'>Actives</h4>
        <p>Choosing actives is a mix of complementing your build, your team (builds, abilities and their actives) and in response to enemy abilities. Choosing wisely can alter the outcome of a game.</p>
<!--        <p>Choosing appropriate actives is important but ultimately comes down to your choice. Shielded Teleport sounds cool. the ability to teleport across the map to a tower? Nice. However, would Greater Sprint serve you better? While a teleport can get you to the front lines faster, Greater Sprint provides immunity to slows, as well as improving movement speed, and can be used during battle as an effective escape.</p>-->
        <h4>Greater Purification (Beads)</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Greater Purification"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/beads.jpg" /></a></div><p>Greater Purification (sometimes known, simply as "beads") is the third level of Purificaion Beads. Using this item removes Crowd Control (CC) effects and gives an immunity to new CC effects for 3 seconds. They also reduce ability cooldowns by 3 seconds. Lower level beads are as useful, however higher level beads cooldowns are faster and thus more useful.</p>

        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Salvation"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/salvation.jpg" /></a></div><p>Salvation restores 35% of you and your team mates Mana, and 15% of you and your team mates maximim Health. If you use a lot of mana, or have a spear item slot this solid choice. Typing VVVG in game will shout your team mates to group up, so they can get healed too.</p>
        <h4>Greater Sprint</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Greater Sprint"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/sprint.jpg" /></a></div><p>Greater Sprint is the third Sprint ability. Using this item increases your movement speed by 40% for 6 seconds and makes the owner immune to slows for the duration.</p>
        <h4>Shielded Teleport</h4>

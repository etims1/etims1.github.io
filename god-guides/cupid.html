        <h3>A Guide to Cupid</h3>
        <p>Cupid excells like most Huntes in lane-clear, he also has High Sustain due to to his Share the Love (2) ability, which heals and regenerates Mana and Flutter (3) his dash, allowing escape. Physical Damage is important to Cupid.</p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <h4>Lovestruck (Passive)</h4>
        <p>Each basic attack hit gives Cupid a stack that increases his damage and the healing of his abilitie, 2% per stack, stacking a maximum of 8 times. This gives cupid a 16% maximum damage and healing increase. At this maximum Heart Bomb (1) and Fields of Love (4) apply a 1 second stun.</p>
        
        <h4>Heart Bomb (1)</h4>
        <p>Heart Bomb is a projectile arrow, fired in the direction Cupid is facing. Upon hitting an enemy it damages and slows movement speed by 20% for 3 seconds. A beating heart icon is added to the target and after 3 seconds the heart explodes, dealing damage (and stunning at max stacks) to the target and all enemies within a radius.</p>
          
        <h4>Share the Love (2)</h4>
        <p>Share the Love places three floating hearts at the target location on the ground. Cupid and allies can pick up the hearts, and are healed. Cupid regenerates Mana when an ally picks up a heart. Hearts last for 8 seconds and their healing is increased by 25% of your Physical Power.</p>
        
        <h4>Flutter (3)</h4>
        <p>Flutter dashes Cupid forward increasing his attack speed by a minimum of 10% for 6 seconds, and leaves a trail behind him that increases ally movement speed by 30%.</p>
        
        <h4>Fields of Love (4)</h4>
        <p>Fields of Love is a very large circular area of affect ability cast at a ground location away from Cupid. This ability slows enemies by 35%, cripples (stops escape abilities, such as jumps and dashes) and mezmerize's for 2.5 enemies within the target area. If Cupid has built max stacks for his passive, Fields of Love will apply a stun, not mezmerise. A mezmerise is broken upon taking damage, a stun isn't broken by damage.</p>

          <h4 class='padding-top'>Tactics</h4>
          <p>Building your passive up to full power is important, because it adds a stun to your first and fourth ability. Which gives you extra time to deal damage to enemies. </p>
          <p>A powerful combination, after building max stacks is Cupid Fields of Love (4), and then Heart Bomb (1). With max stacks, both abilitys stun for 1 second. And both deal enough damage to take down weaker enemy gods.</p>
          <p>Heart Bomb (1) explodes when whatever the heart was attached to dies. This can be useful for stunning enemy gods near their minion wave, by targeting a nearly dead minion. Once the minion dies, Heart Bomb will apply the stun. You will need to have build up the maximum of 8 stacks to have the stun.</p>
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>Cupid has the lowest health of any Hunter in the game. However Cupid has Share the Love (2) to heal himself and Flutter (3) for escape.</p>
          <h4 class='padding-top'>Playing against Cupid</h4>
          <p>As mentioned in the Weaknesses section, Cupid has low health and only has one escape ability. When you see Cupid has used Flutter (3), he can't easily escape, so he is at his most vulnerable.</p>

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Alternative Items</h4>
        <p>This section of the guide aims to encourage you away from using common builds from build websites, like the ones above. Item builds aren't static, after the core items (usually the first three items) the other items should be built in response to your enemy. Use the in-game tab menu to see which items your enemy are building.</p>
        <h4>Ichaival</h4>

Each successful basic attack increases your Physical Power and reduces your targets item-based Physical Power by 10, for three seconds. The debuff stacks 3 times, for a total of -30 Physical Power.</p>
        <h4>Odysseus Bow</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Odysseus' Bow"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/odysseus-bow.jpg" /></a></div><p>Odysseus' Bow gives the owner <strong>+40% Attack Speed</strong>, additonally, every fourth basic attack trigegers chain lightening, which damanges the target and dealing damage to up to 4 other enemies.</p>

        <h4>Asi</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Asi"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/asi.jpg" /></a></div><p>Asi adds <strong>+15% Physical Lifesteal, +20% Attakc Speed</strong> and <strong>+15% Physical Penetration</strong>.

                <h4>Qin's Sais</h4>
        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Qin's Sais"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/qins-sais.jpg" /></a></div><p>Qin's Sais adds <strong>+30 Physical Power</strong> and <strong>+15% Attack Speed</strong>.

        <h4 class='padding-top'>Actives</h4>
        <p>Choosing actives is a mix of complementing your build, your team (builds, abilities and their actives) and in response to enemy abilities. Choosing wisely can alter the outcome of a game.</p>

        <div class='float-left alt-icon'><a href='#' class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Greater Purification"><img alt="" src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/beads.jpg" /></a></div><p>Greater Purification (sometimes known, simply as "beads") is the third level of Purificaion Beads. Using this item removes Crowd Control (CC) effects and gives an immunity to new CC effects for 3 seconds. They also reduce ability cooldowns by 3 seconds.

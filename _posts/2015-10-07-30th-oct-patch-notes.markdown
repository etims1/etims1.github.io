#####Sobek

Sobek's Mana costs have been reduced to allow him to use his abilities more often, making him a more effective support.

> "Lowering his Mana costs means he should be able to protect his teammates and catch enemies much more often. Increasing the utility on his Ultimate means he has better engage potential with this ability, while also allowing this Ultimate to act as a much stronger deterrent for chasing enemies."

#####Xing Tian

Xing Tian's Ultimate, Whirlwind of Rage and Steel, has it's cooldown increased to a standard 100s at all levels to reduce the impact of the "potent, possibly team-wide, Crowd Control effect".

> "... we noticed [Xing Tian's] Ultimate was still providing a high amount of damage tied to a very potent, potentially team-wide, Crowd Control effect. We have adjusted the scaling down, and increased the Cooldown to 100s at all ranks to control the potency of this skill to still be strong, but more manageable."

#####Whirlwind of Rage and Steel

+ Increased Cooldown from 100/95/90/85/80s → 100s at all ranks.

***

![Image of the Smite God Zhong Kui](http://smiteoracle.com/images/blog/inpost-banners/zhong-kui-inpost.jpg)

#####Zhong Kui

> "Zhong Kui is a Mage that needs to get into the middle of the fight to be effective. While he has tools in his kit to help him, we felt that in too many situations he just didn’t have what he needed to get the job done. We have increased some of his base stats, as well as allowed him to have Magical Protection scaling to help him in later phases of the game. We will be watching these changes closely to see how it affects The Demon Queller"
Base Stats

+ Increased base Health from 400 to 450.
+ Increased Health per level from 75 to 85.

![Image of the Smite God Awilix](http://smiteoracle.com/images/blog/inpost-banners/awilix-inpost.jpg)

#####Awilix

Awilix's Ultimate can now pull enemies through walls. HiRez's reasoning was:

> "Often Awilix players find themselves having to hit a very small timing window from when someone took off to when they went behind a wall. We want to reward Awilix for saving the Ultimate to pull a fleeing opponent, even if they have jumped over a wall."

#####Gravity Surge

+ Can now pull enemies through walls with Gravity Surge.

***

#####Hou Yi

Hou Yi has Richocht's cooldown timers reduced to give players a better expeirence when fighting.

> "Hou Yi is a Hunter who lacks a hard steroid to really allow him to box, instead focusing on landing powerful (and Stunning) Ricochets to make up for this. By lowering the Cooldown Hou Yi players should feel more impactful more often while also taking less of a risk when they go for those double bounce trick shots."

#####Ricochet

+ Reduced Cooldown from 14 → 10s.
+ Fixed an issue with projectile accuracy from the sides.

#####Dive Bomb

+ Increased Physical Damage Scaling from 30 → 60%.

***

![Image of the Smite God Mercury](http://smiteoracle.com/images/blog/inpost-banners/mercury-inpost.jpg)

#####Mercury

> "Mercury players who use Fastest God Alive to its fullest often see themselves landing very powerful in-hands out of their Ultimates or when ganking. We like this playstyle and how it forces people to go just far enough with their Ultimate so they can turn around and punch the god with a powerful hit. Because of this we have chosen to up the payoff potential of this Passive."

#####Fastest God Alive

+ Increased maximum damage bonus for distance travelled from 50% → 75%.

#####Special Delivery

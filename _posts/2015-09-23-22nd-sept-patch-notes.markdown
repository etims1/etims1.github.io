This patch we see the Blink family nerfed, Deathbringer receives a Critical Chance reduction. Zeus is rebuilt, Xing Tian sees numerous changes and there are updates to several other gods. We'll start with item changes.

####Item Changes

#####Blink Nerfed

All three tiers of Blink have been nerfed, making them a much less attractive item to escape with. HiRez wanted to increase the distinction between Blinks, making it obvious by item stats which Blink is for initiation and which is for escape. As a result cooldown timers have been increased and time out of combat requirements have been increased. Cooldown timers are also now triggered upon taking damage, making it more clear when it is available.

>"... In its previous form, it [blink] allowed for this mobility too often, and too early for the cost investment. By increasing the cooldown at early ranks, and keeping it mostly low on the highest ranks, players can still enjoy the engage potential of this active while feeling like they made a meaningful choice to pick it up. We also like this as an engage tool, so we nerfed the capability of escaping with it, highlighting Combat Blink as that choice." - HiRez

#####Blink

+ Increased cooldown from 90s to 150s
+ Cooldown timer triggered on taking damage, making it more clear when its available

#####Improved Blink

+ Increased cooldown from 60s to 110s
+ Time out of combat required is increased from 4s to 5s
+ Cooldown timer triggered on taking damage, making it more clear when its available

#####Greater Blink

+ Increased cooldwon from 45s to 70s
+ Movement Speed increased removed after blinking
+ Time out of combat required increases from 3s to 5s
+ Cooldown timer triggered on taking damage, making it more clear when its available

***

#####Deathbringer

HiRez believed Deathbringer was simply too powerful, saying "While effective, it was slightly too effective at what it did and how it scaled with other items." and nerfed it by 10%.

+ Reduced Critical Strike Damage increase from 50% to 40%

#####Khepri

+ Khperi's Ultimate no longer blocks Executes

> "Khepri’s Ultimate is a unique skill that can change the course of a fight instantly. We like his capability to do this, but felt there were some natural places we could add some counterplay." - HiRez

#####Xing Tian

Xing Tian's cahnges relove around improving player experience, HiRez said:

> "... players didn't feel the impact of this damage. His Furious Roar now does slightly less damage but does it’s damage quicker, which should let players feel the impact of the damage being dealt. Whirlwind of Rage and Steel will now allow for more reaction time, deal less damage overall, and deal less damage for players who escape early. We feel that Xing should still be rewarded for hitting this skill for the full duration, but want players who escape to also feel a reward." - HiRez

#####Furious Roar

+ Decreased damage-over-time from 1.5/2/2.5/3/3.5 to 1/2/2/3/3
+ Decreased damage-over-time from 2.5% per 0.5s to 4% per 1s

#####Whirlwind of Range and Steal

+ Targets are now immune to Crowd Control while grabbed
+ Increased warm-up time from 0.6s to 0.75s
+ Decreased damage from 50/75/100/125/150 to 15/25/35/45/55
+ Increased damage for each subsequent spin x2/x2.4/x2.8 after the inital hit
+ Magical scaling reduced from 50% to 20%

#####Zeus

Zeus has the biggest impact change for any god we see this patch, gaining a new ability, Aegis Assault. The changes seem to be HiRez's attempt to define Zeus as a more aggressive Mage, which is perhaps indicated by the name of the new ability.

> "Chain Lightning ... will now bounce much quicker allowing for Zeus to react faster to how the chain bounced. It will also now also slow allowing for better synergy with his new ability and his Ultimate. Lightning Storm is also now castable while moving. This change will let this skill be used more fluidly when needed. His new ability Aegis Assault is a deployable shield that acts as an extension of his attacks. Basic Attacks and Chain lightning will trigger bonus damage for wave clear and those unfortunate to be near the shield, while also acting as a bouncing point for Chain Lightning, allowing Zeus to punish isolated targets. Overall we expect these changes will allow Zeus to thrive as a high aggression and high burst Mage..." - HiRez

#####Chain Lightning

+ Decreased bounce delay from 0.4s to 02s
+ Reduced damage from 45/85/125/165/205 to 40/70/100/130/160
+ Increased cooldown from 8s to 10s
+ Now applies a 30% slow to targets for 2s

#####Aegis Assault

+ Zeus throws a shield forward, dealing 80/125/170/215/260 +50% Magical Power as damage to enemies nearby and applying a charge. The shield remains for 3s, Zeus may hit it with Basic Attacks or Chain Lightning to deal additional 10/20/30/40/50 + Basic Attack Damage.

#####Detonate Charge

+ No longer slows if you have 3 stacks on a target

#####Lightning Storm

+ Zeus is no longer roooted while casting

  We take a brief look at the soon to be released god Sol. She's a Basic Attack focused Mage, set up to be a solid pusher thanks to her Passive, granting her 'Heat'. At 100% Heat, her Basic Attacks deal +50% damage.

####Sol's Kit

#####Unstable Manifestation (Passive)

Sol gains Heat as she uses abilities and hits with Basic Attacks. She gains +1% Magical Power and +1% Attack Speed for every 3% Heat. At 100% Heat, Sol’s Basic Attacks gain +50% Damage. Heat decreases over time.

Basic Attacks : +5% Heat

#####Radiance (1)

Sol burns bright, gaining a large amount of Heat, healing herself over time for (5/10/15/20/25% of missing Health over 5s) and igniting the ground around her. Enemies that walk onto the fire take (30/60/90/120/150 + 25% of your Magical Power) damage every second. This ability provides 40/50/60/70/80% Heat. Cost: 60/70/80/90/100. Cooldown: 15s.

#####Stellar Burst (2)

Sol’s next Basic Attack explodes, creating a shockwave that travels out, dealing (40/70/100/130/160 + 35% of your Magical Power) damage. At full size, the wave retracts, dealing damage again and Slowing enemies. This ability provides 10% Heat. Cost: 60/65/70/75/80. Cooldown: 10s.

#####Disapparate (3)

Sol burns down her manifestation, gaining Movement Speed (30/35/40/45/50%) and ignoring all Movement Penalties, while leaving a trail of fire behind her that damages enemies (20/40/60/80/100 + 25% of your Magical Power) every .5 seconds. After 3s Sol loses corporeal form for a short time and her trail explodes, Stunning enemies for 1.5s. Sol may leave her incorporeal form early. This ability provides 10% Heat. Cost: 60. Cooldown: 15s.

#####Supernova (4)

Sol unleashes all her flame and fury from the sky, striking 8 times along a moveable ground target location. Enemies hit take (150/200/250/300/350 +50% of your Magical Power) damage are knocked back on the first strike, only taking 20% damage on successive hits. This ability generates 10% Heat. Cost: 100.

####Analysis

HiRez's aim with Sol is to create a multi-role, Basic Attack focused Mage.

> "... she would not be a traditional mid lane Mage, but rather have flexibility in a number of different roles." - HiRez Dev Q&A

#####She can Push

Sol is set up to be an "exceptional" Pusher. This is mostly due to her Passive, Unstable Manifestation, which introduces the concept of Heat. As Sol uses her abilities (+10% Heat) and Basic Attacks (+5% Heat) she builds up Heat. For every 3% Heat she gains an additional +1% Magical Power and +1% Attack Speed. When she reaches 100% Heat her Basic Attacks deal +50% Damage. Additional Magical Power, Attack Speed and Damage will allow her to melt towers.

> "Her in-hand damage versus towers is exceptional once her passive reaches full Heat, making her great for pushing" - HiRez Dev Q&A

#####She can Carry

Sol's passive gives her +1% Attack Speed per 3% Heat. This plus the +50% Damage increase will result in high base damage auto-atttacks. Built with appropriate items this may make it possible for Sol to be a legitimate choice for ADC (All Damage Carry).

Sol will likely have High Sustain, being able to stay in-lane for long periods, due to a self-heal (and damaging) ability, Radiance (1).

Sol will also be difficult to hit, Disapparate (3), provides her additional Movement Speed and removes Movement Penalties (most gods move slower backwards and sideways than they do forwards). This is a similar ability to Chrono's and Isis.

#####Over powered?

Heat increases by +10% per ability and +5% with Basic Attacks. With the cooldown times of 15/10/15/90 it will take Sol approximately 45 seconds to get up to 100% Heat using only her four abilities (1/2/3/4, 1/2/3, 1/2/3). However Heat decreases over time, so it will likely take at least a few seconds longer than 45 seconds. 

Coupled with with her self-heal (and damaging ability), Radiance (1) and Disapparate (3), which she uses to gain Movement Speed and looses all Movement Penalties (so she moves backwards and sideways as fast as she does forward) will likely make Sol over powered during the first few weeks of after her release.

The loss of Movement Penalties alone is not over powered, Chrono's and Isis have similar abilities. The combination of all of the above will likely mean Sol is unbalanced at the beginning.

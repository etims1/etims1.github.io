####Sol's Kit

#####Unstable Manifestation (Passive)

Sol gains Heat as she uses abilities and hits with Basic Attacks. She gains +1% Magical Power and +1% Attack Speed for every 3% Heat. At 100% Heat, Sol’s Basic Attacks gain +50% Damage. Heat decreases over time.

Basic Attacks : +5% Heat

####Analysis

HiRez's aim with Sol is to create a multi-role, Basic Attack focused Mage. 

> "... she would not be a traditional mid lane Mage, but rather have flexibility in a number of different roles." - HiRez Dev Q&A

Sol is set up to be an "exceptional" Pusher. This is mostly due to her Passive, Unstable Manifestation, which introduces the concept of Heat. As Sol uses her abilities (+10% Heat) and Basic Attacks (+5% Heat) she builds up Heat. For every 3% Heat she gains an additional +1% Magical Power and +1% Attack Speed. When she reaches 100% Heat her Basic Attacks deal +50% Damage. Additional Magical Power, Attack Speed and Damage will allow her to melt towers.

> "Her in-hand damage versus towers is exceptional once her passive reaches full Heat, making her great for pushing" - HiRez Dev Q&A

Sol will likely have High Sustain due to a self-heal (and damaging) ability, Radiance (1). 

#####Heat

Heat increases by +10% per ability and +5% with Basic Attacks. With the cooldown times of 15/10/15/90 it will take Sol approximately 45 seconds to get up to 100% Heat using only her four abilities (1/2/3/4, 1/2/3, 1/2/3). However Heat decreases oer time, so it will likely take at least a few seconds longer than 45 seconds.
